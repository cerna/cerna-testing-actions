= Configure APT for `raspbian`

NB. +
Raspbian continues as a distro, but the packages it uses are just Jessie armhf ones

As from 22.Oct.2017 specific Raspbian packages will no longer be produced

If you want to continue to update as changes to the code are made +
just substitute *raspbian* in the below stanza with *jessie*

If you have already installed raspbian packages and want to use Jessie, +
purge them first and install anew.


. Add Machinekit repository

[source,bash]
