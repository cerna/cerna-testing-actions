== NAME
*hy_vfd* - HAL userspace component for Huanyang VFDs

== SYNOPSIS
*hy_vfd* [OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION
This component connects the Huanyang VFD to the LinuxCNC HAL via a serial
(RS-485) connection.
The Huanyang VFD must be configured via the face plate user interface
to accept serial communications. However, to avoid malfunction the
following parameter should be configured:

|===
| *PD001 = 2* |
Set register PD001 (source of run commands) to 2.

0 ... operator +
1 ... external terminal +
1 ... external terminal +
2 ... communication port

| *PD002 = 2* |
Set register PD002 (source of operating frequency) to 2.

0 ... operator board +
1 ... board potentiometer +
2 ... communication port

| *PD005* |
Set register PD005 (max operating frequency) according to motor specs.
This is the maximum frequency of the motor's power supply, in [Hz].

| *PD011* |
Set register PD011 (min frequency) according to motor specs.  This is
the minimum frequency of the motor's power supply, in [Hz].

| *PD141* |
Set register PD141 (rated motor voltage) according to motor name plate.
This is the motor's maximum voltage, in [V].

| *PD142* |
Set register PD142 (rated motor current) according to motor name plate.
This is the motor's maximum current, in [A].

|*PD143* |
Set register PD143 (Number of Motor Poles) according to motor name plate.

|*PD144* |
Set register PD144 (rated motor revolutions) according to motor name
plate.  This is the motor's speed in RPM at 50 Hz.  Note: This is not the
motor's max speed (unless the max motor frequency happens to be 50 Hz)!

|*PD163 = 1* |
Set register PD163 (communication address) to 1 (default 0).

range: 0 ... 240 +
0 ... invalid address

|*PD164 = 2* |
Set register PD164 (baud rate [b/s]) to 2 (19200).  This matches the
default in the hy_vfd driver, change this if your setup has special needs.

0 ...  4800 +
1 ...  9600 +
2 ... 19200 +
3 ... 348400

| *PD165 = 3* |
Set register PD165 (communication data method) to 3 (8n1 RTU).
This matches the default in the hy_vfd driver, change this if your
setup has special needs.  Note that the hy_vfd driver only supports RTU
communication, not ASCII.

0 ... 8N1 ASCII +
1 ... 8E1 ASCII +
2 ... 8O1 ASCII +
3 ... 8N1 RTU +
4 ... 8E1 RTU +
5 ... 8O1 RTU

Consult the Huanyang instruction manual for details on using the face
plate to program the VFDs registers, and alternative values for the
above registers.

== OPTIONS
[cols="10%,90%",frame="none", grid="none",]
|===
| *-d, --device <path>* |
(default: /dev/ttyS0) Set the name of the serial device node to use.
| *-g, --debug* |
Turn on debug messages. Note that if there are serial errors, this may
become annoying.  Debug mode will cause all serial communication messages
to be printed in hex on the terminal.
| *-n, --name <string>* |
(default: hy_vfd) Set the name of the HAL module. The HAL comp name will be
set to <string>, and all pin and parameter names will begin with <string>.
| *-b, --bits <n>*|
(default 8) Set number of data bits to <n>, where n must be from 5
to 8 inclusive.  This must match the setting in register PD165 of the
Huanyang VFD.
| *-p, --parity [even,odd,none]* |
(default: odd) Set serial parity to even, odd, or none.  This must match
the setting in register PD165 of the Huanyang VFD.
| *-r, --rate <n>* |
(default: 38400) Set baud rate to <n>. It is an error if the rate is
not one of the following: 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200,
38400, 57600, 115200.  This must match the setting in register PD164 of
the Huanyang VFD.
| *-s, --stopbits [1,2]* |
(default: 1) Set serial stop bits to 1 or 2.  This must match the setting
in register PD165 of the HuanyangVFD.
| *-t, --target <n>* |
(default: 1) Set HYCOMM target (slave) number. This must match the device
number you set on the Hyanyang VFD in register PD163.
| *-F, --max-frequency <n>* |
(default: read from VFD) If specified, program register PD005 of the VFD
with the specified max frequency of <n> Hz (and use the same max frequency
in the hy_vfd driver).  If not specified, read the max frequency to use
from register PD005 of the VFD.
| *-f, --min-frequency <n>* |
(default: read from VFD) If specified, program register PD011 of the
VFD with the specified minimum frequency of <n> Hz (and use the same
minimum frequency in the hy_vfd driver).  If not specified, read the
minimum frequency to use from register PD011 of the VFD.
| *-U, --motor-voltage <n>* |
(default: read from VFD) If specified, program register PD141 of the VFD
with the specified max motor voltage of <n> Volts.  If not specified,
read the max motor voltage from register PD141 of the VFD.
| *-I, --motor-current <n>* |
(default: read from VFD) If specified, program register PD142 of the
VFD with the specified max motor current of <n> Amps.  If not specified,
read the max motor current from register PD142 of the VFD.
| *-S, --motor-speed <n>* |
(default: compute from value read from VFD P144) This command-line
argument is the motor's max speed.  If specified, compute the motor's
speed at 50 Hz from this argument and from the motor's max frequency
(from the --max-frequency argument or from P011 if --max-frequency is
not specified) and program register PD144 of the VFD.  If not specified,
read the motor's speed at 50 Hz from register P144 of the VFD, and use
that and the max frequency to compute the motor's max speed.
| *-P, --motor-poles <n>* |
(default: read value from VFD P143) This command-line argument is the
number of poles in the motor.  If specified, this value is sent to the
VFD's register PD143.  If not specified, the value is read from PD143
and reported on the corresponding HAL pin.
