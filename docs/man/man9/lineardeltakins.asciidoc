== NAME
**lineardeltakins** - Kinematics for a linear delta robot

== SYNOPSIS
**loadrt lineardeltakins**

== KINEMATICS
The kinematics model is appropriate for a rostock/kossel-style design
with three joints arranged in an equilateral triangle.  (0,0) is always
the center of the working volume. +
Joint 0 is at (0,R) and subsequent joints are 120 degrees clockwise (note that joint 0 is not at zero
radians).  The length of the arm is L.

Joints 0-2 are the linear carriages.  Axes ABC and UVW are passed
through unchanged in joints 3-8, so that e.g., A can still be used to
control an extruder.

Three pins have been provided for joints 0-2, to allow for offset trimming 
during calibration. +
It is suggested that these pins are only used during 
calibration to determine the proper distance between the work surface and 
the limit switches for each joint. +
Once the proper distance has been determined 
the pins should be set to zero and update each joints home parameters in the INI
file.
 
== PINS

**lineardeltakins**.__R__ float in

[indent=4]
====
Effective diameter of the platform.

__R__ is different than the distance from the center of the table to the
center of the belt/smooth rod/extrusion that the joints ride on. 

InRepRap delta parlance, R is DELTA_RADIUS which is computed as
DELTA_SMOOTH_ROD_OFFSET-DELTA_EFFECTOR_OFFSET-DELTA_CARRIAGE_OFFSET.
====

**lineardeltakins**.__L__ float in

[indent=4]
====
Length of the rod connecting the carriage to the effector.  

In RepRap delta parlance, __L__ is DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD
====

**lineardeltakins**.__J0offs__ float in

[indent=4]
====
Offset distance applied to Joint 0
====

**lineardeltakins**.__J1offs__ float in

[indent=4]
====
Offset distance applied to Joint 1
====

**lineardeltakins**.__J2offs__ float in

[indent=4]
====
Offset distance applied to Joint 2 
====

== NOTES
The __R__ and __L__ and joint offset values can be adjusted while Machinekit is running.

However, doing so while in coordinated mode will lead to a step change in joint
position, which generally will trigger a following error if in joint
mode with machine on.
