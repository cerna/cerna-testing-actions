== NAME
**linuxcnc** -- Startup script for machinekit


== DESCRIPTION

This script is aliased as **machinekit**, so refer to that manual page for a description of its usage.

The references to Linuxcnc will persist in the medium term due to complex
inter-dependence issues, especially where names are hard coded in other code.

Effort has been put into improving and expanding code, especially regards HAL, rather than
simply re-branding every single instance of the Linuxcnc name without adding any value or
added functionality.
