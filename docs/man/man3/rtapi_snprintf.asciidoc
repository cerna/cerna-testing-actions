== NAME

**rtapi_snprintf**, **rtapi_vsnprintf** -- Perform snprintf-like string formatting



== SYNTAX
**int rtapi_snprintf** ( **char** *__buf__, **unsigned long int** __size__, **const char** *__fmt__, __...__)

**int rtapi_vsnprintf** ( **char** *__buf__, **unsigned long int** __size__, **const char** *__fmt__, **va_list** __apfB__)



== ARGUMENTS
As for __snprintf__ or __vsnprintf__.



== DESCRIPTION
These functions work like the standard C printf functions, except that a
reduced set of formatting operations are supported.

Formatting of
floating-point values is done as though with %A even when other formats like %f
are specified.



== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
May be called from user, init/cleanup, and realtime code.



== RETURN VALUE
The number of characters written to __buf__.



== SEE ALSO
**printf**
