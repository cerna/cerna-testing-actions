= Xenomai realtime kernel (i386)

Choose and copy and paste the following into a shell to install your kernel:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install linux-image-xenomai.x86-686-pae      # i386
----

[NOTE]
There are only Xenomai kernels for Wheezy and Jessie not Stretch or Buster

= RT-PREEMPT realtime kernel (i386)

== Debian Wheezy has an older RT-PREEMPT kernel 

This is installable with

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install linux-image-3.2.0-4-rt-686-pae
or just
sudo apt-get install linux-image-rt-686-pae
----

== Debian Jessie has now been backported to the Debian Stretch rt-preempt kernel

You need to add a line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file

[source,bash]
----
sudo echo "deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports main contrib non-free" \
 >> /etc/apt/sources.list
----

(You can change *uk* for whatever your geographic mirror location)

Then update apt and pull the kernel

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-image-rt-686-pae
----

== Debian Stretch and Buster repos contain rt-preempt kernels

Update apt and pull the kernel

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-image-rt-686-pae
----

If you want to build your own kernel, see the Developing section for more details.
