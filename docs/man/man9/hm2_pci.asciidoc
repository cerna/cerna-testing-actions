== NAME
**hm2_pci** - Machinekit HAL driver for the Mesa Electronics PCI-based Anything IO boards, with HostMot2 firmware.


== SYNOPSIS
**loadrt hm2_pci** __[config=**"str[,str...]"**]__

**config** __[default: ""]__
HostMot2 config strings, described in the hostmot2 manpage.

== DESCRIPTION
**hm2_pci** is a device driver that interfaces Mesa's PCI and PC-104/Plus
based Anything I/O boards (with the HostMot2 firmware) to the Machinekit
HAL.

The supported boards are: the 5i20, 5i22, and 5i23 (all on PCI); the
4i65 and 4i68 (on PC-104/Plus), and the 3x20 (on PCI Express, probably
using a 6i68 or 7i68 carrier card).

The driver programs the board's FPGA with firmware when it registers
the board with the hostmot2 driver.  The firmware to load is specified
in the **config** modparam, as described in the hostmot2(9) manpage,
in the __config modparam__ section.
