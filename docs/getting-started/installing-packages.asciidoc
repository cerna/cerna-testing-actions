Follow these steps to configure Apt and install a kernel and Machinekit packages:

[NOTE]
1) The kernel-naming convention used in these packages may change as
experience is accumulated, especially with ARM-based systems. Be sure to
check back here before installing a new kernel.

[NOTE]
2)  Do NOT try to install more than one machinekit-{kernel-flavour} package on the same partition.
The packages now contain some kernel-flavour set files which used to be in the machinekit-dev
package and they conflict with each other. If you require to switch between different kernels on the same partition, build
a development RIP build and run from that.

== EOL distributions ==

When a debian distribution becomes EOL it is not recommended to use
these packages. The Machinekit project will stop producing packages and
support for that distribution.

If you for whatever reason need to use these packages, please follow this
link to link:../unsupported-packages[the unsupported packages page].
